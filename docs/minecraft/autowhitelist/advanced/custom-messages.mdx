### Basic JSON understanding is highly recommended

Customizing the messages is pretty simple.

# Lite
For the lite version head over to `config/autowhitelist/messages.json`  
To apply the changes run `/autowhitelist reload translations`

# Full
For the full version you need to create a datapack

To create the datapack you must head to you world folder, than to `datapacks`
There you create a folder with the name of your choice
Inside the folder create a `pack.mcmeta` file and an `autowhitelist` folder
On `pack.mcmeta` put the following:
```json
{
    "pack": {
        "description": "Custom messages for AutoWhitelist",
        "pack_format": 10        
    }
}
``` 
Feel free to customize the `description` content

Inside the `autowhiteist` folder create a `lang` folder

Now inside the `lang` folder you created create a new file called `en_us.json`
On that file you will customize the mod messages.

You DON'T need to include all translations, only the ones you want to change.

You also will want to run `/datapack enable <your datapack>`
If you have the datapack enabled make sure to run `/reload` to update the translations
