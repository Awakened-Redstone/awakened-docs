        <summary>Setting the entries</summary>

        On the config file, `entries` will be empty by default, there you will configure what the server will do when whitelisting the players.
        There are **4** types of entries, for vanilla you have `TEAM` and `COMMAND`, if you have luckperms you can also use `LUCKPERMS_GROUP` and `LUCKPERMS_PERMISSION`.
        All of them takes a list of `roleIds` that will be used to whitelist the players, and a `type` that will be used to determine what the server will do when whitelisting the players.
        The default format is
        ```json5 copy
        {
            //The Discord role ids that will be used to whitelist the players
            "roleIds": ["Discord role id"],
            //The method that will be used to whitelist the players
            "type": "TYPE"
        }
        ```
