# Introduction

:::warning
While this mod is not required on the client, the lack of it may result in weird behavior
:::

Default Components allows you to change the data components of any item in the game, vanilla and modded.  
The mod works with datapacks and can be easily setup

If the mod is present on the client it will synchronize all the components so everything looks as it should

## Creating a datapack

To create the datapack you must head to you world folder, then to `datapacks`
There you create a folder with the name of your choice
Inside the folder create a `pack.mcmeta` file and a `data` folder

On `pack.mcmeta` put the following:
```json title="pack.mcmeta"
{
  "pack": {
    "description": "Custom default components",
    "pack_format": 34
  }
}
```
Feel free to customize the `description` content

Inside the `data` folder you will create a new folder with the name being the namespace of the item you want to change

## Configuring

All items have a unique ID on the following format: `namespace:path`  
To visualize that enable advanced tooltips with `F3 + H`, it will show on the bottom of the item tooltip  
Also keep note of the `path`, you will need it soon

**To modify the components of ALL items the namespace must be `minecraft`**

Create a folder called `default_components` and navigate into it

Now create a file named `<path>.json` with `<path>` being the item's path  
**If you want to modify the components of all items, they file must be named `all.json`**

Now inside that file put the following content:
```json
{
  "add": {},
  "remove": []
}
```

Inside `add` you will put the components to add, on the format `"<component>": <value>`  
For `remove` you will use the format `"<component>"`

:::danger
Some components are required for items to function, and removing them may render them useless or even result in crashes
:::
    
At the end it should look something like this:
```json
{
  "add": {
    "minecraft:food": {
      "saturation": 1,
      "nutrition": 1
    }
  },
  "remove": [
    "minecraft:max_stack_size"
  ]
}
```
Now your datapack is ready to use!

To enable it run `/datapack enable <datapack>`  
If you already have the datapack enabled simply run `/reload`
