The whitelist cache is an implementation made to allow users that already registered before to join back without having to rerun the registration command<br/>
Once a user looses their role or leaves the server they are removed from the whitelist, removing all track of the user, the cache will keep the user UUID to whitelist them
when they join back after regaining the role. The process was optimized to be fast, giving a seamless experience to the user.
