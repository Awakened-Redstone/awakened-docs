title: Custom messages
---

import {OnlineCode} from "../../../src/components/OnlineCode";

:::tip Recommendation
  Basic JSON knowledge is highly recommended
:::

To customize the messages you need to create a datapack

To create the datapack you must head to you world folder, then to `datapacks`
There you create a folder with the name of your choice
Inside the folder create a `pack.mcmeta` file and an `autowhitelist` folder

On `pack.mcmeta` put the following:
```json title="pack.mcmeta"
{
    "pack": {
        "description": "Custom messages for AutoWhitelist",
        "pack_format": 10        
    }
}
``` 
Feel free to customize the `description` content

Inside the `autowhiteist` folder create a folder called `lang`

Now inside the `lang` folder create a new file called `en_us.json`<br/>
On that file you will customize the mod messages.

:::tip
  You don't need to include all translations, only the ones you want to change.
:::

You will also want to run `/datapack enable <your datapack>` <br/>
If you already have the datapack enabled make sure to run `/reload` to update the translations
